## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Use The CSS Reset Basics of John Comeau
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the basics of CSS and HTML a lot and it's great to apply it in a project like this.

```html
<hr> I know hr tag is use for inserting line but it's not easy to remember it(maybe just in my case) haha.
```
```css
.image{
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
    border-radius: 0.05rem;
}
Grid is one the property that i'm least familar with so it is good or not idon't know but it worked. 


### Continued development

As a beggineer or i should say newbie in a field of frontend Devlop.I would like to focus on basics and other projects as well and I really wanted to reduce the length of my CSS by doing effective work.
